In this paper, we\\nexplore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-speciﬁc actions\\nin an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning\\ntraces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle\\nexceptions, while actions allow it to interface with and gather additional information\\nfrom external sources such as knowledge bases or environments. We apply our\\napproach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks\\nand demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines in addition to\\nimproved human interpretability and trustworthiness. Concretely, on question\\nanswering (HotpotQA) and fact veriﬁcation (Fever), ReAct overcomes prevalent\\nissues of hallucination and error propagation in chain-of-thought reasoning by\\ninteracting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generating human-like task-solving\\ntrajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces.\\nFurthermore, on two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and\\nWebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by\\nan absolute success rate of 34% and 10% respectively, while being prompted with\\nonly one or two in-context examples.\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nA unique feature of human intelligence is the ability to seamlessly combine task-oriented actions with\\nverbal reasoning (or inner speech, Alderson-Day & Fernyhough, 2015), which has been theorized to\\nplay an important role in human cognition for enabling self-regulation or strategization (Vygotsky,\\n1987; Luria, 1965; Fernyhough, 2010) and maintaining a working memory (Baddeley, 1992). Con-\\nsider the example of cooking up a dish in the kitchen. Between any two speciﬁc actions, we may\\nreason in language in order to track progress (“now that everything is cut, I should heat up the pot of\\nwater”), to handle exceptions or adjust the plan according to the situation (“I don’t have salt, so let\\nme use soy sauce and pepper instead”), and to realize when external information is needed (“how do\\nI prepare dough? Let me search on the Internet”). We may also act (open a cookbook to read the\\nrecipe, open the fridge, check ingredients) to support the reasoning and to answer questions (“What\\ndish can I make right now?”). This tight synergy between “acting” and “reasoning” allows humans\\nto learn new tasks quickly and perform robust decision making or reasoning, even under previously\\nunseen circumstances or facing information uncertainties.\\nRecent results have hinted at the possibility of combining verbal reasoning with interactive decision\\nmaking in autonomous systems. On one hand, properly prompted large language models (LLMs)\\nhave demonstrated emergent capabilities to carry out several steps of reasoning traces to derive\\n∗Work during Google internship.

1: (1) Comparison of 4 prompting methods, (a) Standard, (b) Chain-of-thought ( CoT,\\nReason Only), (c) Act-only, and (d) ReAct (Reason+Act), solving a HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018)\\nquestion. (2) Comparison of (a) Act-only and (b) ReAct prompting to solve an AlfWorld (Shridhar\\net al., 2020b) game. In both domains, we omit in-context examples in the prompt, and only show task\\nsolving trajectories generated by the model (Act, Thought) and the environment (Obs).\\nanswers from questions in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks (Wei et al.,\\n2022). However, this “chain-of-thought” reasoning is a static black box, in that the model uses\\nits own internal representations to generate thoughts and is not grounded in the external world,\\nwhich limits its ability to reason reactively or update its knowledge. This can lead to issues like fact\\nhallucination and error propagation over the reasoning process (Figure 1 (1b)). On the other hand,\\nrecent work has explored the use of pre-trained language models for planning and acting in interactive\\nenvironments (Ahn et al., 2022; Nakano et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2022a), with\\na focus on predicting actions via language priors. These approaches usually convert multi-modal\\nobservations into text, use a language model to generate domain-speciﬁc actions or plans, and then\\nuse a controller to choose or execute them. However, they do not employ language models to reason\\nabstractly about high-level goals or maintain a working memory to support acting, barring Huang\\net al. (2022b) who perform a limited form of verbal reasoning to reiterate spatial facts about the\\ncurrent state. Beyond such simple embodied tasks to interact with a few blocks, there have not been\\nstudies on how reasoning and acting can be combined in a synergistic manner for general task solving,\\nand if such a combination can bring systematic beneﬁts compared to reasoning or acting alone.\\nIn this work, we present ReAct, a general paradigm to combine reasoning and acting with language\\nmodels for solving diverse language reasoning and decision making tasks (Figure 1). ReAct\\nprompts LLMs to generate both verbal reasoning traces and actions pertaining to a task in an\\ninterleaved manner, which allows the model to perform dynamic reasoning to create, maintain, and\\nadjust high-level plans for acting (reason to act), while also interact with the external environments\\n(e.g. Wikipedia) to incorporate additional information into reasoning (act to reason).\\n2'), Document(metadata={'source': './2210.03629v3-2.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nWe conduct empirical evaluations ofReAct and state-of-the-art baselines on four diverse benchmarks:\\nquestion answering (HotPotQA, Yang et al., 2018), fact veriﬁcation (Fever, Thorne et al., 2018),\\ntext-based game (ALFWorld, Shridhar et al., 2020b), and webpage navigation (WebShop, Yao\\net al., 2022). For HotPotQA and Fever, with access to a Wikipedia API that the model can interact\\nwith, ReAct outperforms vanilla action generation models while being competitive with chain-of-\\nthought reasoning (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022). The best approach overall is a combination of ReAct\\nand CoT that allows for the use of both internal knowledge and externally obtained information\\nduring reasoning. On ALFWorld and WebShop, two or even one-shot ReAct prompting is able\\nto outperform imitation or reinforcement learning methods trained with 103 ∼105 task instances,\\nwith an absolute improvement of 34% and 10% in success rates respectively. We also demonstrate\\nthe importance of sparse, versatile reasoning in decision making by showing consistent advantages\\nover controlled baselines with actions only. Besides general applicability and performance boost,\\nthe combination of reasoning and acting also contributes to model interpretability, trustworthiness,\\nand diagnosability across all domains, as humans can readily distinguish information from model’s\\ninternal knowledge versus external environments, as well as inspect reasoning traces to understand\\nthe decision basis of model actions.\\nTo summarize, our key contributions are the following: (1) we introduce ReAct, a novel prompt-\\nbased paradigm to synergize reasoning and acting in language models for general task solving; (2) we\\nperform extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks to showcase the advantage ofReAct in a\\nfew-shot learning setup over prior approaches that perform either reasoning or action generation in\\nisolation; (3) we present systematic ablations and analysis to understand the importance of acting in\\nreasoning tasks, and reasoning in interactive tasks; (4) we analyze the limitations ofReAct under the\\nprompting setup (i.e. limited support of reasoning and acting behaviors), and perform initial ﬁnetuning\\nexperiments showing the potential of ReAct to improve with additional training data. Scaling up\\nReAct to train and operate on more tasks and combining it with complementary paradigms like\\nreinforcement learning could further unlock the potential of large language models.\\n2 REAC T: S YNERGIZING REASONING + AC TING\\nConsider a general setup of an agent interacting with an environment for task solving. At time\\nstep t, an agent receives an observation ot ∈O from the environment and takes an action at ∈A\\nfollowing some policy π(at|ct), where ct = (o1,a1,··· ,ot−1,at−1,ot) is the context to the agent.\\nLearning a policy is challenging when the mapping ct ↦→at is highly implicit and requires extensive\\ncomputation. For example, the agent shown in Figure 1(1c) is unable to generate the correct ﬁnal\\naction (Act 4) to ﬁnish the QA task as it requires complex reasoning over the trajectory context\\n(Question, Act 1-3, Obs 1-3). Similarly, the agent shown in Figure 1(2a) fails to comprehend from the\\ncontext that sinkbasin 1 does not contain peppershaker 1, thus keep producing hallucinating actions.\\nThe idea of ReAct is simple: we augment the agent’s action space to ˆA= A∪L, where Lis the\\nspace of language. An action ˆat ∈L in the language space, which we will refer to as a thought or a\\nreasoning trace, does not affect the external environment, thus leading to no observation feedback.\\nInstead, a thought ˆat aims to compose useful information by reasoning over the current context ct,\\nand update the context ct+1 = (ct,ˆat) to support future reasoning or acting. As shown in Figure 1,\\nthere could be various types of useful thoughts, e.g. decomposing task goals and create action plans\\n(2b, Act 1; 1d, Thought 1), injecting commonsense knowledge relevant to task solving (2b, Act 1),\\nextracting important parts from observations (1d, Thought2, 4), track progress and transit action plans\\n(2b, Act 8), handle exceptions and adjust action plans (1d, Thought 3), and so on.\\nHowever, as the language space Lis unlimited, learning in this augmented action space is difﬁcult\\nand requires strong language priors. In this paper, we mainly focus on the setup where a frozen\\nlarge language model, PaLM-540B (Chowdhery et al., 2022)1, is prompted with few-shot in-context\\nexamples to generate both domain-speciﬁc actions and free-form language thoughts for task solving\\n(Figure 1 (1d), (2b)). Each in-context example is a human trajectory of actions, thoughts, and\\nenvironment observations to solve a task instance (see Appendix C). For the tasks where reasoning is\\nof primary importance (Figure 1(1)), we alternate the generation of thoughts and actions so that the\\ntask-solving trajectory consists of multiple thought-action-observation steps. In contrast, for decision\\nmaking tasks that potentially involve a large number of actions (Figure 1(2)), thoughts only need to\\n1We show some GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) results in Appendix A.1, which outperforms PaLM-540B.\\n3'), Document(metadata={'source': './2210.03629v3-2.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nappear sparsely in the most relevant positions of a trajectory, so we let the language model decide the\\nasynchronous occurrence of thoughts and actions for itself.\\nSince decision making and reasoning capabilities are integrated into a large language model, ReAct\\nenjoys several unique features: A) Intuitive and easy to design : Designing ReAct prompts is\\nstraightforward as human annotators just type down their thoughts in language on top of their actions\\ntaken. No ad-hoc format choice, thought design, or example selection is used in this paper. We detail\\nprompt design for each task in Sections 3 and 4. B) General and ﬂexible: Due to the ﬂexible thought\\nspace and thought-action occurrence format, ReAct works for diverse tasks with distinct action\\nspaces and reasoning needs, including but not limited to QA, fact veriﬁcation, text game, and web\\nnavigation. C) Performant and robust: ReAct shows strong generalization to new task instances\\nwhile learning solely from one to six in-context examples, consistently outperforming baselines with\\nonly reasoning or acting across different domains. We also show in Section 3 additional beneﬁts\\nwhen ﬁnetuning is enabled, and in Section 4 how ReAct performance is robust to prompt selections.\\nD) Human aligned and controllable: ReAct promises an interpretable sequential decision making\\nand reasoning process where humans can easily inspect reasoning and factual correctness. Moreover,\\nhumans can also control or correct the agent behavior on the go by thought editing, as shown in\\nFigure 5 in Section 4.\\n3 K NOWLEDGE -INTENSIVE REASONING TASKS\\nWe begin with knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks like multi-hop question answering and fact\\nveriﬁcation. As shown in Figure 1(1d), by interacting with a Wikipedia API, ReAct is able to\\nretrieve information to support reasoning, while also use reasoning to target what to retrieve next,\\ndemonstrating a synergy of reasoning and acting.\\n3.1 S ETUP\\nDomains We consider two datasets challenging knowledge retrieval and reasoning: (1) Hot-\\nPotQA (Yang et al., 2018), a multi-hop question answering benchmark that requires reasoning\\nover two or more Wikipedia passages, and (2) FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018), a fact veriﬁcation\\nbenchmark where each claim is annotated SUPPORTS, REFUTES, or NOT ENOUGH INFO, based\\non if there exists a Wikipedia passage to verify the claim. In this work, we operate in a question-only\\nsetup for both tasks, where models only receive the question/claim as input without access to support\\nparagraphs, and have to rely on their internal knowledge or retrieve knowledge via interacting with\\nan external environment to support reasoning.\\nAction Space We design a simple Wikipedia web API with three types of actions to support\\ninteractive information retrieval: (1) search[entity], which returns the ﬁrst 5 sentences from\\nthe corresponding entity wiki page if it exists, or else suggests top-5 similar entities from the\\nWikipedia search engine, (2) lookup[string], which would return the next sentence in the page\\ncontaining string, simulating Ctrl+F functionality on the browser. (3) finish[answer], which\\nwould ﬁnish the current task with answer. We note that this action space mostly can only retrieve a\\nsmall part of a passage based on exact passage name, which is signiﬁcantly weaker than state-of-the-\\nart lexical or neural retrievers. The purpose is to simulate how humans would interact with Wikipedia,\\nand force models to retrieve via explicit reasoning in language.\\n3.2 M ETHODS\\nReAct Prompting For HotpotQA and Fever, we randomly select 6 and 3 cases2 from the training\\nset and manually compose ReAct-format trajectories to use as few-shot exemplars in the prompts.\\nSimilar to Figure 1(d), each trajectory consists of multiple thought-action-observation steps (i.e. dense\\nthought), where free-form thoughts are used for various purposes. Speciﬁcally, we use a combination\\nof thoughts that decompose questions (“I need to search x, ﬁnd y, then ﬁnd z”), extract information\\nfrom Wikipedia observations (“x was started in 1844”, “The paragraph does not tell x”), perform\\ncommonsense (“x is not y, so z must instead be...”) or arithmetic reasoning (“1844 < 1989”), guide\\n2We ﬁnd more examples do not improve performance.\\n4'), Document(metadata={'source': './2210.03629v3-2.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nPrompt Methoda HotpotQA Fever\\n(EM) (Acc)\\nStandard 28.7 57.1\\nCoT(Wei et al., 2022) 29.4 56.3\\nCoT-SC(Wang et al., 2022a) 33.4 60.4\\nAct 25.7 58.9\\nReAct 27.4 60.9\\nCoT-SC→ReAct 34.2 64.6\\nReAct→CoT-SC 35.1 62.0\\nSupervised SoTAb 67.5 89.5\\nTable 1: PaLM-540B prompting results on\\nHotpotQA and Fever.\\naHotpotQA EM is 27.1, 28.9, 33.8 for Standard, CoT,\\nCoT-SC in Wang et al.

See Appendix C for more details.\\nBaselines We systematically ablateReAct trajectories to build prompts for multiple baselines (with\\nformats as Figure 1(1a-1c)): (a) Standard prompting (Standard), which removes all thoughts,\\nactions, observations in ReAct trajectories. (b) Chain-of-thought prompting (CoT) (Wei et al.,\\n2022), which removes actions and observations and serve as a reasoning-only baseline. We also\\nbuild a self-consistency baseline (CoT-SC) (Wang et al., 2022a;b) by sampling 21 CoT trajectories\\nwith decoding temperature 0.7 during inference and adopting the majority answer, which is found to\\nconsistently boost performance over CoT. (c) Acting-only prompt (Act), which removes thoughts\\nin ReAct trajectories, loosely resembling how WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021) interacts with the\\nInternet to answer questions, though it operates on a different task and action space, and uses imitation\\nand reinforcement learning instead of prompting.\\nCombining Internal and External Knowledge As will be detail in Section 3.3, we observe that\\nthe problem solving process demonstrated by ReAct is more factual and grounded, whereas CoT\\nis more accurate in formulating reasoning structure but can easily suffer from hallucinated facts\\nor thoughts. We therefore propose to incorporate ReAct and CoT-SC, and let the model decide\\nwhen to switch to the other method based on the following heuristics: A) ReAct →CoT-SC: when\\nReAct fails to return an answer within given steps, back off to CoT-SC. We set 7 and 5 steps for\\nHotpotQA and FEVER respectively as we ﬁnd more steps will not improve ReAct performance3.\\nB) CoT-SC →ReAct: when the majority answer among nCoT-SC samples occurs less than n/2\\ntimes (i.e. internal knowledge might not support the task conﬁdently), back off to ReAct.\\nFinetuning Due to the challenge of manually annotating reasoning traces and actions at scale,\\nwe consider a bootstraping approach similar to Zelikman et al. (2022), using 3,000 trajectories\\nwith correct answers generated by ReAct (also for other baselines) to ﬁnetune smaller language\\nmodels (PaLM-8/62B) to decode trajectories (all thoughts, actions, observations) conditioned on\\ninput questions/claims. More details are in Appendix B.1.\\n3.3 R ESULTS AND OBSERVATIONS\\nReAct outperforms Act consistently Table 1 shows HotpotQA and Fever results using PaLM-\\n540B as the base model with different prompting methods. We note that ReAct is better than Act\\non both tasks, demonstrating the value of reasoning to guide acting, especially for synthesizing the\\nﬁnal answer, as shown in Figure 1 (1c-d). Fine-tuning results 3 also conﬁrm the beneﬁt of reasoning\\ntraces for more informed acting.\\n3Of all trajectories with correct ﬁnal answers, those with 7 steps on HotpotQA and 5 steps on FEVER only\\ntake up 0.84% and 1.33% respectively.\\n5'), Document(metadata={'source': './2210.03629v3-2.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nType Deﬁnition ReAct CoT\\nSuccess True positive Correct reasoning trace and facts 94% 86%\\nFalse positive Hallucinated reasoning trace or facts 6% 14%\\nFailure\\nReasoning error Wrong reasoning trace (including failing to recover from repetitive steps) 47% 16%\\nSearch result error Search return empty or does not contain useful information 23% -\\nHallucination Hallucinated reasoning trace or facts 0% 56%\\nLabel ambiguity Right prediction but did not match the label precisely 29% 28%\\nTable 2: Types of success and failure modes of ReAct and CoT on HotpotQA, as well as their\\npercentages in randomly selected examples studied by human.\\nReAct vs. CoT On the other hand, ReAct outperforms CoT on Fever (60.9 vs. 56.3) and slightly\\nlags behind CoT on HotpotQA (27.4 vs. 29.4). Fever claims for SUPPORTS/REFUTES might only\\ndiffer by a slight amount (see Appendix D.1), so acting to retrieve accurate and up-to-date knowledge\\nis vital. To better understand the behavioral difference between ReAct and CoT on HotpotQA, we\\nrandomly sampled 50 trajectories with correct and incorrect answers (judged by EM) from ReAct\\nand CoT respectively (thus 200 examples in total), and manually labeled their success and failure\\nmodes in Table 2. Some key observations are as follows:\\nA) Hallucination is a serious problem for CoT, resulting in much higher false positive rate than\\nReAct (14% vs. 6%) in success mode, and make up its major failure mode (56%). In contrast, the\\nproblem solving trajectory of ReActis more grounded, fact-driven, and trustworthy, thanks to the\\naccess of an external knowledge base.\\nB) While interleaving reasoning, action and observation steps improves ReAct’s grounded-\\nness and trustworthiness, such a structural constraint also reduces its ﬂexibility in formulating\\nreasoning steps, leading to more reasoning error rate than CoT. we note that there is one frequent\\nerror pattern speciﬁc to ReAct, in which the model repetitively generates the previous thoughts and\\nactions, and we categorize it as part of “reasoning error” as the model fails to reason about what the\\nproper next action to take and jump out of the loop4.\\nC) For ReAct, successfully retrieving informative knowledge via search is critical. Non-\\ninformative search, which counts for 23% of the error cases, derails the model reasoning and gives\\nit a hard time to recover and reformulate thoughts. This is perhaps an expected trade-off between\\nfactuality and ﬂexibility, which motivates our proposed strategies of combining two methods.\\nWe provide examples for each success and failure modes in Appendix E.1. We also ﬁnd some\\nHotpotQA questions may contain outdated answer labels, see Figure 4 for example.\\nReAct + CoT-SC perform best for prompting LLMs Also shown in Table 1, the best prompting\\nmethod on HotpotQA and Fever are ReAct →CoT-SC and CoT-SC →ReAct respectively.\\nFurthermore, Figure 2 shows how different methods perform with respect to the number of CoT-SC\\nsamples used. While two ReAct + CoT-SC methods are advantageous at one task each, they both\\nsigniﬁcantly and consistently outperform CoT-SC across different number of samples, reaching\\nCoT-SC performance with 21 samples using merely 3-5 samples. These results indicate the value of\\nproperly combining model internal knowledge and external knowledge for reasoning tasks.\\nReAct performs best for ﬁne-tuning Figure 3 shows the scaling effect of prompting/ﬁnetuning\\nfour methods (Standard, CoT, Act, ReAct) on HotpotQA. With PaLM-8/62B, promptingReAct\\nperforms worst among four methods due to the difﬁculty to learn both reasoning and acting from\\nin-context examples. However, when ﬁnetuned with just 3,000 examples, ReAct becomes the best\\nmethod among the four, with PaLM-8B ﬁnetuned ReAct outperforming all PaLM-62B prompting\\nmethods, and PaLM-62B ﬁnetuned ReAct outperforming all 540B prompting methods. In contrast,\\nﬁnetuning Standard or CoT is signiﬁcantly worse than ﬁnetuning ReAct or Act for both PaLM-\\n8/62B, as the former essentially teaches models to memorize (potentially halluincated) knowledge\\nfacts, and the latter teaches models how to (reason and) act to access information from Wikipedia, a\\nmore generalizable skill for knowledge reasoning. As all prompting methods are still signiﬁcantly\\nfar from domain-speciﬁc state-of-the-art approaches (Table 1), we believe ﬁnetuning with more\\nhuman-written data might be a better way to unleash the power of ReAct.\\n4We suspect that this could be due to the sub-optimal greedy decoding procedure, and future work using\\nbetter decoding (e.g. beam search) might help address this issue.\\n6'), Document(metadata={'source': './2210.03629v3-2.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\n8b 62b 540b\\nsize\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30HotpotQA EM\\nlearning = prompt\\n8b 62b 540b\\nsize\\nlearning = finetune\\nMethod\\nStandard\\nCoT\\nAct\\nReAct\\nFigure 3: Scaling results for prompting and ﬁnetuning on HotPotQA withReAct (ours) and baselines.\\n4 D ECISION MAKING TASKS\\nWe also test ReAct on two language-based interactive decision-making tasks, ALFWorld and\\nWebShop, both of which feature complex environments that require agents to act over long horizons\\nwith sparse rewards, warranting the need for reasoning to act and explore effectively.\\nALFWorld ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2020b) (Figure 1(2)) is a synthetic text-based game designed\\nto align with the embodied ALFRED benchmark (Shridhar et al., 2020a). It includes 6 types of\\ntasks in which an agent needs to achieve a high-level goal (e.g. examine paper under desklamp) by\\nnavigating and interacting with a simulated household via text actions (e.g. go to coffeetable 1, take\\npaper 2, use desklamp 1). A task instance can have more than 50 locations and take an expert policy\\nmore than 50 steps to solve, thus challenging an agent to plan and track subgoals, as well as explore\\nsystematically (e.g. check all desks one by one for desklamp). In particular, one challenge built into\\nALFWorld is the need to determine likely locations for common household items (e.g. desklamps will\\nlikely be on desks, shelfs, or dressers), making this environment a good ﬁt for LLMs to exploit their\\npretrained commonsense knowledge. To prompt ReAct, we randomly annotate three trajectories\\nfrom the training set for each task type, where each trajectory includes sparse thoughts that (1)\\ndecompose the goal, (2) track subgoal completion, (3) determine the next subgoal, and (4) reason via\\ncommonsense where to ﬁnd an object and what to do with it. We show prompts used for ALFWorld\\nin Appendix C.4. Following Shridhar et al. (2020b), we evaluate on 134 unseen evaluation games\\nin a task-speciﬁc setup. For robustness, we construct 6 prompts for each task type through each\\npermutation of 2 annotated trajectories from the 3 we annotate. Act prompts are constructed using\\nthe same trajectories, but without thoughts — since task instances are randomly chosen from the\\ntraining set, it favors neitherReAct nor Act and provides a fair and controlled comparison to test the\\nimportance of sparse thoughts. For baselines, we use BUTLER (Shridhar et al., 2020b), an imitation\\nlearning agent trained on 105 expert trajectories for each task type5.\\nWebShop Can ReAct also interact with noisy real-world language environments for practical\\napplications? We investigate WebShop (Yao et al., 2022), a recently proposed online shopping\\nwebsite environment with 1.18M real-world products and 12k human instructions. Unlike ALFWorld,\\nWebshop contains a high variety of structured and unstructured texts (e.g. product titles, descriptions,\\nand options crawled from Amazon), and requires an agent to purchase a product based on a user\\ninstruction (e.g. “I am looking for a nightstand with drawers. It should have a nickel ﬁnish, and\\npriced lower than $140”) through web interactions (e.g. search “nightstand drawers”, choose buttons\\nsuch as “color: modern-nickel-white” or “back to search”). This task is evaluated by average score\\n(percentage of desired attributes covered by the chosen product averaged across all episodes) and\\nsuccess rate (percentage of episodes where the chosen product satisﬁes all requirements) on 500 test\\ninstructions. We formulate Act prompts with actions to search, choose product, choose options,\\nand buy, with ReAct prompts additionally reasoning to determine what to explore, when to buy,\\nand what products options are relevant to the instruction. See Table 6 for an example prompt, and\\nTable 10 for model predictions in the Appendix. We compare to an imitation learning (IL) method\\n5Micheli & Fleuret (2021) ﬁnetuned a GPT-2 model on 3553 task instances and achieved a much improved\\nperformance than BUTLER, but it is trained on all task types, thus not included as a baseline.\\n7'), Document(metadata={'source': './2210.03629v3-2.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nMethod Pick Clean Heat Cool Look Pick 2 All\\nAct(best of 6) 88 42 74 67 72 41 45\\nReAct(avg) 65 39 83 76 55 24 57\\nReAct(best of 6) 92 58 96 86 78 41 71\\nReAct-IM(avg) 55 59 60 55 23 24 48\\nReAct-IM(best of 6) 62 68 87 57 39 33 53\\nBUTLERg (best of 8) 33 26 70 76 17 12 22\\nBUTLER(best of 8) 46 39 74 100 22 24 37\\nTable 3: AlfWorld task-speciﬁc success rates (%).

On\\nALFWorld, the bestReAct trial achieves an average success rate of 71%, signiﬁcantly outperforming\\nthe best Act (45%) and BUTLER (37%) trials. In fact, even the worse ReAct trial (48%) beats\\nthe best trial of both methods. Moreover, the advantage of ReAct over Act is consistent across\\nsix controlled trials, with relative performance gain ranging from 33% to 90% and averaging 62%.\\nQualitatively, we saw that, without any thoughts at all, Act fails to correctly decompose goals\\ninto smaller subgoals, or loses track of the current state of the environment. Example trajectories\\ncomparing ReAct and Act can be found in Appendix D.2.1 and Appendix D.2.2.\\nOn Webshop, one-shot Act prompting already performs on par with IL and IL+RL methods. With\\nadditional sparse reasoning, ReAct achieves signiﬁcantly better performance, with an absolute 10%\\nimprovement over the previous best success rate. By checking examples, we ﬁnd that ReAct is more\\nlikely to identify instruction-relevant products and options by reasoning to bridge the gap between\\nnoisy observations and actions (e.g. “For ‘space-saving ottoman bench for living room’, the item\\nhas options ‘39x18x18inch’ and ‘blue’ and seems good to buy.”). However, existing methods are\\nstill far from the performance of expert humans (Table 4), who perform signiﬁcantly more product\\nexplorations and query re-formulations that are still challenging for prompting-based methods.\\nOn the value of internal reasoning vs. external feedback To our knowledge, ReAct is the ﬁrst\\ndemonstration of combined reasoning and action using an LLM applied to an interactive environment\\nwithin a closed-loop system. Perhaps the closest prior work is Inner Monologue (IM), from Huang\\net al. (2022b), in which actions from an embodied agent are motivated by an eponymous “inner\\nmonologue”. However, IM’s “inner monologue” is limited to observations of the environment\\nstate and what needs to be completed by the agent for the goal to be satisﬁed. In contrast, the\\nreasoning traces in ReAct for decision making is ﬂexible and sparse, allowing diverse reasoning\\ntypes (see Section 2) to be induced for different tasks.\\nTo demonstrate the differences between ReAct and IM, and to highlight the importance of internal\\nreasoning vs. simple reactions to external feedback, we ran an ablation experiment using a thought\\npattern composed of IM-like dense external feedback. As can be seen in Table 3,ReAct substantially\\noutperforms IM-style prompting ( ReAct-IM) (71 vs. 53 overall success rate), with consistent\\nadvantages on ﬁve out of six tasks. Qualitatively, we observed that ReAct-IM often made mistakes\\nin identifying when subgoals were ﬁnished, or what the next subgoal should be, due to a lack of high-\\nlevel goal decomposition. Additionally, many ReAct-IM trajectories struggled to determine where\\nan item would likely be within the ALFWorld environment, due to a lack of commonsense reasoning.\\nBoth shortcomings can be addressed in the ReAct paradigm. More details about ReAct-IM is in\\nAppendix B.2. An example prompt for ReAct-IM can be found in Appendix C.4, and an example\\ntrajectory in Appendix D.2.3.\\n8'), Document(metadata={'source': './2210.03629v3-2.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\n5 R ELATED WORK\\nLanguage model for reasoning Perhaps the most well-known work of using LLMs for reasoning\\nis Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022), which reveals the ability of LLMs to formulate their\\nown “thinking procedure” for problem solving. Several follow-up works have since been performed,\\nincluding least-to-most prompting for solving complicated tasks (Zhou et al., 2022), zero-shot-\\nCoT (Kojima et al., 2022), and reasoning with self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022a). Recently,\\n(Madaan & Yazdanbakhsh, 2022) systematically studied the formulation and structure of CoT, and\\nobserved that the presence of symbols, patterns and texts is crucial to the effectiveness of CoT. Other\\nwork has also been extended to more sophisticated reasoning architecture beyond simple prompting.\\nFor example Selection-Inference (Creswell et al., 2022) divides the reasoning process into two steps\\nof “selection” and “inference”. STaR (Zelikman et al., 2022) bootstraps the reasoning process by\\nﬁnetuning the model on correct rationales generated by the model itself. Faithful reasoning (Creswell\\n& Shanahan, 2022) decomposes multi-step reasoning into three steps, each performed by a dedicated\\nLM respectively. Similar approaches like Scratchpad (Nye et al., 2021), which ﬁnetunes a LM on\\nintermediate computation steps, also demonstrate improvement on multi-step computation problems.\\nIn contrast to these methods, ReAct performs more than just isolated, ﬁxed reasoning, and integrates\\nmodel actions and their corresponding observations into a coherent stream of inputs for the model to\\nreason more accurately and tackle tasks beyond reasoning (e.g. interactive decision making).\\nLanguage model for decision making The strong capability of LLMs has enabled them to perform\\ntasks beyond language generation, and it is becoming more popular to take advantage of LLMs as a\\npolicy model for decision making, especially in interactive environments. WebGPT (Nakano et al.,\\n2021) uses an LM to interact with web browsers, navigate through web pages, and infer answers to\\ncomplicated questions from ELI5 (Fan et al., 2019). In comparison to ReAct, WebGPT does not\\nexplicitly model the thinking and reasoning procedure, instead rely on expensive human feedback for\\nreinforcement learning. In conversation modeling, chatbots like BlenderBot (Shuster et al., 2022b)\\nand Sparrow (Glaese et al., 2022) and task-oriented dialogue systems like SimpleTOD (Hosseini-Asl\\net al., 2020) also train LMs to make decision about API calls. Unlike ReAct, they do not explicitly\\nconsider the reasoning procedure either, and also relies on expensive datasets and human feedback\\ncollections for policy learning. In contrast, ReAct learns a policy in a much cheaper way, since the\\ndecision making process only requires language description of the reasoning procedure.6\\nLLMS have also been increasingly employed in interactive and embodied environments for planning\\nand decision making. Perhaps most relevant to ReAct in this respect are SayCan (Ahn et al., 2022)\\nand Inner Monologue (Huang et al., 2022b), which use LLMs for robotic action planning and decision\\nmaking. In SayCan, LLMs were prompted to directly predict possible actions a robot can take, which\\nis then reranked by an affordance model grounded on the visual environments for ﬁnal prediction.\\nInner Monologue made further improvements by adding the eponymous “inner monologue\", which is\\nimplemented as injected feedback from the environment. To our knowledge, Inner Monologue is the\\nﬁrst work that demonstrates such a closed-loop system, which ReAct builds on. However, we argue\\nthat Inner Monologue does not truly comprise of inner thoughts — this is elaborated in Section 4. We\\nalso note that leveraging language as semantically-rich inputs in the process of interactive decision\\nmaking has been shown to be successful under other settings (Abramson et al., 2020; Karamcheti\\net al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022a; Li et al., 2022). It is becoming more evident that with the help of\\nLLMs, language as a fundamental cognitive mechanism will play a critical role in interaction and\\ndecision making. What is more, progress in LLMs has also inspired the development of versatile and\\ngeneralist agents like Reed et al. (2022).\\n6 C ONCLUSION\\nWe have proposedReAct – a simple yet effective method for synergizing reasoning and acting in\\nlarge language models. Through a diverse set of experiments on multi-hop question-answering, fact\\nchecking, and interactive decision-making tasks, we show that ReAct leads to superior performance\\nwith interpretable decision traces. Despite the simplicity of our method, complex tasks with large\\naction spaces require more demonstrations to learn well, which unfortunately can easily go beyond\\nthe input length limit of in-context learning. We explore the ﬁne-tuning approach on HotpotQA\\n6Human feedback can also be incorporated in a complementary manner but we leave it for future work.\\n9'), Document(metadata={'source': './2210.03629v3-2.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nwith initial promising results, but learning from more high-quality human annotations will be the\\ndesiderata to further improve the performance. Scaling up ReAct with multi-task training and\\ncombining it with complementary paradigms like reinforcement learning could result in stronger\\nagents that further unlock the potential of LLMs for more applications.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe thank the support and feedback of many people from Google Brain team and Princeton NLP\\nGroup.

To increase reproducibility, we have included all used prompts in Appendix C, additional\\nexperiments using GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) in Appendix A.1, and associated GPT-3 ReAct\\nprompting code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReAct-2268/.\\nETHICS STATEMENT\\nReAct prompts large language models to generate more human interpretable, diagnosable, and\\ncontrollable task-solving trajectories than previous methods. However, hooking up a large language\\nmodel with an action space to interact with external environments (e.g. the web, physical environ-\\nments) has potential dangers, e.g. looking up inappropriate or private information, or taking harmful\\nactions in an environment. Our experiments minimize such risks by limiting the interactions to\\nspeciﬁc websites (Wikipedia or WebShop) that are free of private information, without any dangerous\\nactions in the action space design (i.e. models cannot really buy products on WebShop the research\\nbenchmark, or edit Wikipedia). We believe researchers should be aware of such risks before designing\\nmore extensive experiments in the future.\\nREFERENCES\\nJosh Abramson, Arun Ahuja, Iain Barr, Arthur Brussee, Federico Carnevale, Mary Cassin, Rachita\\nChhaparia, Stephen Clark, Bogdan Damoc, Andrew Dudzik, Petko Georgiev, Aurelia Guy, Tim\\nHarley, Felix Hill, Alden Hung, Zachary Kenton, Jessica Landon, Timothy Lillicrap, Kory Mathew-\\nson, Soˇna Mokrá, Alistair Muldal, Adam Santoro, Nikolay Savinov, Vikrant Varma, Greg Wayne,\\nDuncan Williams, Nathaniel Wong, Chen Yan, and Rui Zhu.

Figure 5 shows that by simply removing a hallucinating sentence in Act\\n17 and adding some hints in Act 23, ReAct can be made to change its behavior drastically to align\\nwith these human thought edits and succeed in the task.

5: A human-in-the-loop behavior correction example with ReAct in AlfWorld. (a) ReAct\\ntrajectory fails due to a hallucinating thought (Act 17). (b) By a human simply editing two thoughts\\n(Act 17, 23), the ReAct trajectory produces desirable reasoning traces and actions and succeeds.\\nis difﬁcult for Act and previous RL methods, as a human cannot change the model parameters, and\\nchanging a few actions might not edit the rest of the model behavior. This paradigm is also more than\\nhuman dialogue to update the goal or subgoal as in Huang et al. (2022b) — while editing ReAct\\nthoughts can do these, it can also modify the model’s internal belief, reasoning styles, or anything the\\nﬂexible thought space supports, for better task solving. We believe this is an exciting direction for\\nhuman alignment and leave more systematic study as future work.\\nB E XPERIMENT DETAILS\\nB.1 H OTPOT QA F INETUNING DETAILS\\nFor all ﬁnetuning we use a batch size of 64. On PaLM-8B, we ﬁnetune ReAct and Act methods\\nfor 4,000 steps and Standard and CoT methods for 2,000 steps. On PaLM-62B, we ﬁnetune\\nReAct and Act methods for 4,000 steps and Standard and CoT methods for 1,000 steps. We\\nﬁnd ReAct and Act methods generally beneﬁt from more training steps (and more training data),\\nwhile Standard and CoT methods degrade soon after ﬁnetuning.\\nB.2 A LFWORLD IM-S TYLE DETAILS\\nFor the IM-style ablation, the same expert trajectories used in ReAct are reannotated with dense\\nexternal feedback thoughts within these trajectories, that limit ReAct-IM to only think about (1)\\ndecomposing the current goal and (2) the current subgoal that needs to be completed. In particular,\\nReAct-IM lacks thoughts that (1) determine when a subgoal is completed (2) determine what the\\nnext subgoal should be (3) inducing the LLM to refer to its internal pretraining knowledge to identify\\nwhere items can be within the environment.\\n15'), Document(metadata={'source': './2210.03629v3-2.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nC P ROMPTS\\nC.1 H OTPOT QA\\nHotpot QA Prompts\\nOriginal\\nQuestion What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the\\nColorado orogeny extends into?\\nAnswer 1,800 to 7,000 ft\\nQuestion Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\"\\ncharacter Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\\nAnswer Richard Nixon\\nQuestion Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The\\nSaimaa Gesture?\\nAnswer The Saimaa Gesture\\nQuestion What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\\nAnswer director, screenwriter, actor\\nQuestion Which magazine was started first Arthur’s Magazine or First for Women?\\nAnswer Arthur’s Magazine\\nQuestion Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin known for the same type of work?\\nAnswer Yes\\nAct\\nQuestion What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the\\nColorado orogeny extends into?\\nAction 1 Search[Colorado orogeny]\\nObservation 1 The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in\\nColorado and surrounding areas.\\nAction 2 Lookup[eastern sector]\\nObservation 2 (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called\\nthe Central Plains orogeny.\\nAction 3 Search[High Plains]\\nObservation 3 High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\\nAction 4 Search[High Plains (United States)]\\nObservation 4 The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains.
